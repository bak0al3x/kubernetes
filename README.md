# Kubernetes

In this repository, I collect my settings, and some Wiki about how to install and use Kubernetes
using the local dev environment provided by minikube.

The goal is with this repo, to have

- A fully functioning Kubernetes environment
- Some app, which can be deployed to Kubernetes (most probably this will be a React app for starters)

In terms of tech stack, I'd like to use something similar to the following:

- GitHub for code hosting
- Artifactory for artifact hosting
- Jenkins/Other for CI/CD
- TBD
